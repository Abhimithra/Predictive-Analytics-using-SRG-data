# Predictive-Analytics-using-SRG-data

Tried to answer 10 important aspects through this project.
Lets dive into it.
Project Descriptions: 
The data used for this project was real time survey data provided by SRG(Sterling Rice Group). SRG basically is a media company which is a brand consultancy and advertising agency that works across the entire lifecycle of a brand.  This survey included physical and psychological aspects of a person as well as some general information.  We have built a model that clusters consumers associated with health and wellness  Profiled each market segment, predicted health scores(1-7) using Python and SAS.
Project Requirements: I have used SAS and Python for this project.
Project Results and Recomendations: There were many insights that we were able to obtain from this project. Some of them are 
1.Married or living w/ partner has a positive coefficient but then number of household members has a negative coefficient. A conclusion that could be drawn from this is that single parents with children and others who live with roommates run the chance of not being able to improve their wellness score.The more the numer of people, the more they could potentially encourage each other to give up on living a healthy life. 
2.Those consumers who are not following a low sodium diet are more likely to be disproving their wellness score, low sodium and wellness score have proven to be negatively correlated. A mind blowing observation from this sample is the vegetarian diet. Believe it or not, those who specified No to vegetarian diet, are improving their wellness score by 22 points on average. 
3.The last dietary restrictions concluded to have a positive significant impact on the wellness score is Allergen free. Low sodium and Allergen free could be the main points that a grocery store would want to highlight in advertising, to attract health conscious customers. 
4.Eating healthy and improving the wellness score is not terribly dependent on how poor or rich someone is. On the contrary it is more dependent on their lifestyle, dietary restrictions, and education.
